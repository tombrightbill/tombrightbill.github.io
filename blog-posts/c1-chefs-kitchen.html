      	 <p class="img_text">I have to say I really enjoyed watching that video. Shareef really nailed a number of things I think we are all thinking. The movement on my mindset has run the gamut from, 'This is too hard!' to 'This is too easy! and normally ends at 'Am I crazy? Do I have any idea what I'm doing?' To me, learning how to undertake something completely new and challenging like this is almost as big of a mental challenge as a technical one.</p>
      	 <p class="img_text">I am looking forward to learning in such a dynamic environment! I really enjoyed the bits about how in order to create an atmosphere where everyone is comfortable saying 'I don't know', the competitive nature in the cohort can only be friendly at it's most extreme. I feel the same way. I'm prepared to scream 'I don't know' from the get go, and I hope everyone else is as well. I'm just glad, to Shareef's point, there is enough demand for people with this skillset that we can actually focus on learning the material and teaching each other, rather than looking to one up all the time.</p>
      	 <p class="img_text">I would certainly be lying if I didn't say I was nervous. This first week has already been pretty demanding and we have 8 more of those! Then we're in a classroom for 12 hours a day? It's going to be what I hope is a trasformative journey, so I'm probably equal parts nervous and excited.</p>
