        <h1 class="title">Post Three: Visual Learner</h1>
        <p class="img_text">For this post we have been tasked with contemplating our learning style and what that will mean for our development as programmers.</p>
        <p>Personally, I wasn't too sure of my learning style when I first started, but that quickly changed as we started moving! I can absolutely say 100%, without a doubt, I am a visual and hands on learner. I perform best when I can <b>see</b> an example of something being done. I struggle mightily with lengthy articles or books on programming. I don't know why but my brain freezes up and I feel like I'm reading Greek. However, give me a video to watch and follow along with, and I've got it in no time. After reflecting on this a bit, I think I've always been this way, but it seems more pronounced on this particularly journey. Growing up playing sports, I always preferred to watch and follow along with my own movements. Same thing in college; multivariate calculus made no sense when I read about it, but when the teacher would go through an extensive example I felt much more at ease.</p>
        <p>I'm also noticing a change in terms of what I think I can do. I'm not quite ready to say I can do anything just yet, but I'll be dammed it I don't give it a shot. I'm find that once I became comfortable <em>knowing that I don't know everything</em>, research just becomes an accepted part of the process. Now I look forward to research as a way to improve my skillset vs an intimidating process</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post Two: Fireside Redux</h1>
        <p class="img_text">I have to say I really enjoyed watching that video. Shareef really nailed a number of things I think we are all thinking. The movement on my mindset has run the gamut from, 'This is too hard!' to 'This is too easy! and normally ends at 'Am I crazy? Do I have any idea what I'm doing?' To me, learning how to undertake something completely new and challenging like this is almost as big of a mental challenge as a technical one.</p>
         <p class="img_text">I am looking forward to learning in such a dynamic environment! I really enjoyed the bits about how in order to create an atmosphere where everyone is comfortable saying 'I don't know', the competitive nature in the cohort can only be friendly at it's most extreme. I feel the same way. I'm prepared to scream 'I don't know' from the get go, and I hope everyone else is as well. I'm just glad, to Shareef's point, there is enough demand for people with this skillset that we can actually focus on learning the material and teaching each other, rather than looking to one up all the time.</p>
         <p class="img_text">I would certainly be lying if I didn't say I was nervous. This first week has already been pretty demanding and we have 8 more of those! Then we're in a classroom for 12 hours a day? It's going to be what I hope is a trasformative journey, so I'm probably equal parts nervous and excited.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post One: Favorite Websites</h1>
        <p class="img_text"><a class ="web_link" href="http://longform.org/">Longform.org</a>, this is one of my favorite websites for longer content. The articles are curated from reliable sources and are always well written. Personally, I think it's a superbly uncluttered design that allows you to simply scroll through the stories on the left and choose what interests you. I'd say the website is minimalist, organized, branded well, and somehow exudes a library like feel appropriate for a website delivering meaty content.  This website solves the user issue of finding meaningful content. You can filter everything based on specific categories like "business" or "entertainment". Or simply choose from the whole list of curated articles. It's minimalist design makes the page extremely navigable. I always feel more educated after visiting Longoform, as the articles typically take a more exhaustive approach to content vs something shorter and sensational.</p>
         <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, The quintessential start up news source, Y Combinator's Hacker news is a website I frequent a lot. I think it's dated appearance is meant to draw the focus away from the superficial and allow users to focus on content. Though one of the more intimidating and difficult to navigate news webistes, it's extremely intelligent community keeps the content very relavent. There is very little styling on the website, which very much resembles a Reddit like forum, but with less clutter.</p>
         <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="http://pitchfork.com"/>Pitchfork</a>, A respected music website, I find myself frequenting this spot to discover new tunes. Like anything relating to music, presention is paramount, and Pitchfork really excels here. The branding and imagery is on point, making the the website appear as trendy as the music it reviews. Additionally, the ability to stream almost anything form the website is great. Occasionally, it can suffer from feeling cluttered, as its panel layout continues for ages. However, this is probably just part and parcel with trying to deliver coverage on 100s of artists at once. A very slick website who's only drawback in my opinion, is delivering too much content.</p>
