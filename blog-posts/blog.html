        <h1 class="title">Post Three: All About Hashes</h1>
        <p>One of the most common data structures in Ruby is called a hash. A hash can most easily be understood as something similar to an array, but rather than having numeric indices, they can be whatever you want! Pretty cool.</p>
        <p>Effectively, you can determine the key and value of the hash object. This is different than an array where the key is always pretermined(numeric starting from index[0]). For example, I could have a key of 'brother', 'mother', and 'father', with corresponding values of 'John', 'Mary' and 'Tom Sr.'. This could be defined within a hash called 'family'</p>
        <p>There are a number of ways to intialize a hash. At the moment I think the easiest is the following: <code>family= {'brother'=>'John', 'father'=> 'Tom Sr', 'mother'=>'Mary'}</code></p>
        <p>In the code above you can see I've set the key 'brother'='John' and so on. If I call <code>family['brother']</code> it will return <code>'John'</code>. Additionally if you are iterating over a hash you can pass two values and have access to both the keys and the values in the hash!</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post Two: Why Javascript?</h1>
        <p>In this post I will discuss my understanding of the applications of Javascript thus far.</p>
        <p>Javascript is a client side scripting language and is rendered by the browser on your local machine. This means the code is passed to the browser and the it's up to the browser to run it. One advantage of this is you can actually see any JS running in your browser. You can observe it take place in the console via your devtools.</p>
        <p>Working in tandem with HTML and CSS, JS can help bring a webpage to life with animations and allows you to directly interact with elements in the DOM. For example if you wanted the background image of a div to change when the user clicks on that div, JS would be your go to! You'd simply use an event handler, like an 'onclick' and use JS to dynamically replace the image. Pretty cool no?</p>
        <p>In essence, Javascript allows the webpage to respond to user actions without the need to reload the page. For example, you don't have to fill out a lengthy form, submit it, then have the system tell you mistakes were made anymore. JS can help you validate the entries as you are making them, right on your web browser. This gets rid of a step (validating on the server side) and makes the user experience much better.</p>
        <p>Also, JS can be used asynchronously (in the background). This means that functions can run outside of the document flow, and request information from the server without any interaction or need to re-load a web page. This discipline is called AJAX (asynchronous Javascript and XML). This is a bit beyond our current level at the moment but I'm excited to get there and learn about it!

        <h1 class="title">Post One: Thoughts on Display</h1>
        <p class="img_text">A really challenging part of learning all this new information is the need to understand and memorize properties quickly. In order to create even the most basic web site, you'll need an understanding of a number of css properties. Today, I'm going to talk about the difference between <code>display:inline</code> vs <code>display:inline-block.</code></p>
        <p class='img_text'>In order to understand these two ways of displaying block elements inline, it's important to understand the two over arching structures that define html elements. An element can be one of two types, and <code>inline</code> element or a <code>block</code> element. So what distinguishes the two?
        <p class='img_text'>This paragraph is a block element. A block element can accept specifications like 'padding' and 'margin' both vertically and horizontally. However, it's defining characteristic is the line break that preceeds and follows it by default. A block element will also take up the full width available. </p>
        <p class='img_text'>An inline element, such as a <code>span</code> is displayed 'inline' meaning it cannot accept vertical margin or padding (horizontal is acceptable) and is not followed by a line break. It will only take up as much width as needed. Additionally, it allows other elements to sit on it's left and right by default.</p>
        <p class='img_text'>So with the definition of 'inline' and 'block' settled, let's move on to <code>display:inline-block</code>. This will take an element and display it 'inline' meaning it will not be preceeded and followed by a line break. It also will only take up as much width as needed. However, it CAN accept vertical and horizontal margin/padding.</p>
        <p class='img_text'> The following text has the <code>display:inline-block</code> property set. <span class ='inlineblock'>Inline-Block Text.</span>Notice how it has both vertical and horizontal margin and padding? Also notice how this text is pushed down due to the padding and margin surrounding the text.</p>
        <p class='img_text'>The following text has the <code>display:inline</code> property set. If you inspect the element you see I have tried to set a vertical margin and it is not accepted. <span class='inline'>Inline Text.</span> An interesting thing to note about inline elements displayed this way, is that you can specify a padding both horizontally and vertically. The nearby elements will only move to accomodate the padding left and right but the vertical padding will show up and go into the space of the nearby elements. See the example in the next paragraph.</p>
        <p>The text following is displayed inline but has a vertical and horizontal padding. <span class='inlinepadding'>This is displayed inline.</span> Notice how the padding just sort of expands vertically? The padding will expand into the elements around it, but it won't force anything farther down the page.</p>
