        <h1 class="title">Post Three: Thoughts on Display</h1>
        <p class="img_text">A really challenging part of learning all this new information is the need to understand and memorize properties quickly. In order to create even the most basic web site, you'll need an understanding of a number of css properties. Today, I'm going to talk about the difference between <code>display:inline</code> vs <code>display:inline-block.</code></p>
        <p class='img_text'>In order to understand these two ways of displaying block elements inline, it's important to understand the two over arching structures that define html elements. An element can be one of two types, and <code>inline</code> element or a <code>block</code> element. So what distinguishes the two?
        <p class='img_text'>This paragraph is a block element. A block element can accept specifications like 'padding' and 'margin' both vertically and horizontally. However, it's defining characteristic is the line break that preceeds and follows it by default. A block element will also take up the full width available. </p>
        <p class='img_text'>An inline element, such as a <code>span</code> is displayed 'inline' meaning it cannot accept vertical margin or padding (horizontal is acceptable) and is not followed by a line break. It will only take up as much width as needed. Additionally, it allows other elements to sit on it's left and right by default.</p>
        <p class='img_text'>So with the definition of 'inline' and 'block' settled, let's move on to <code>display:inline-block</code>. This will take an element and display it 'inline' meaning it will not be preceeded and followed by a line break. It also will only take up as much width as needed. However, it CAN accept vertical and horizontal margin/padding.</p>
        <p class='img_text'> The following text has the <code>display:inline-block</code> property set. <span class ='inlineblock'>Inline-Block Text.</span>Notice how it has both vertical and horizontal margin and padding? Also notice how this text is pushed down due to the padding and margin surrounding the text.</p>
        <p class='img_text'>The following text has the <code>display:inline</code> property set. If you inspect the element you see I have tried to set a vertical margin and it is not accepted. <span class='inline'>Inline Text.</span> An interesting thing to note about inline elements displayed this way, is that you can specify a padding both horizontally and vertically. The nearby elements will only move to accomodate the padding left and right but the vertical padding will show up and go into the space of the nearby elements. See the example in the next paragraph.</p>
        <p>The text following is displayed inline but has a vertical and horizontal padding. <span class='inlinepadding'>This is displayed inline.</span> Notice how the padding just sort of expands vertically? The padding will expand into the elements around it, but it won't force anything farther down the page.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post Two: Fireside Redux</h1>
        <p class="img_text">I have to say I really enjoyed watching that video. Shareef really nailed a number of things I think we are all thinking. The movement on my mindset has run the gamut from, 'This is too hard!' to 'This is too easy! and normally ends at 'Am I crazy? Do I have any idea what I'm doing?' To me, learning how to undertake something completely new and challenging like this is almost as big of a mental challenge as a technical one.</p>
         <p class="img_text">I am looking forward to learning in such a dynamic environment! I really enjoyed the bits about how in order to create an atmosphere where everyone is comfortable saying 'I don't know', the competitive nature in the cohort can only be friendly at it's most extreme. I feel the same way. I'm prepared to scream 'I don't know' from the get go, and I hope everyone else is as well. I'm just glad, to Shareef's point, there is enough demand for people with this skillset that we can actually focus on learning the material and teaching each other, rather than looking to one up all the time.</p>
         <p class="img_text">I would certainly be lying if I didn't say I was nervous. This first week has already been pretty demanding and we have 8 more of those! Then we're in a classroom for 12 hours a day? It's going to be what I hope is a trasformative journey, so I'm probably equal parts nervous and excited.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post One: Favorite Websites</h1>
        <p class="img_text"><a class ="web_link" href="http://longform.org/">Longform.org</a>, this is one of my favorite websites for longer content. The articles are curated from reliable sources and are always well written. Personally, I think it's a superbly uncluttered design that allows you to simply scroll through the stories on the left and choose what interests you. I'd say the website is minimalist, organized, branded well, and somehow exudes a library like feel appropriate for a website delivering meaty content.  This website solves the user issue of finding meaningful content. You can filter everything based on specific categories like "business" or "entertainment". Or simply choose from the whole list of curated articles. It's minimalist design makes the page extremely navigable. I always feel more educated after visiting Longoform, as the articles typically take a more exhaustive approach to content vs something shorter and sensational.</p>
         <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, The quintessential start up news source, Y Combinator's Hacker news is a website I frequent a lot. I think it's dated appearance is meant to draw the focus away from the superficial and allow users to focus on content. Though one of the more intimidating and difficult to navigate news webistes, it's extremely intelligent community keeps the content very relavent. There is very little styling on the website, which very much resembles a Reddit like forum, but with less clutter.</p>
         <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="http://pitchfork.com"/>Pitchfork</a>, A respected music website, I find myself frequenting this spot to discover new tunes. Like anything relating to music, presention is paramount, and Pitchfork really excels here. The branding and imagery is on point, making the the website appear as trendy as the music it reviews. Additionally, the ability to stream almost anything form the website is great. Occasionally, it can suffer from feeling cluttered, as its panel layout continues for ages. However, this is probably just part and parcel with trying to deliver coverage on 100s of artists at once. A very slick website who's only drawback in my opinion, is delivering too much content.</p>
