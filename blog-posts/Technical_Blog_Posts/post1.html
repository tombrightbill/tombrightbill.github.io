        <h1 class="title">Post One: Thoughts on Display</h1>
        <p class="img_text">A really challenging part of learning all this new information is the need to understand and memorize properties quickly. In order to create even the most basic web site, you'll need an understanding of a number of css properties. Today, I'm going to talk about the difference between <code>display:inline</code> vs <code>display:inline-block.</code></p>
        <p class='img_text'>In order to understand these two ways of displaying block elements inline, it's important to understand the two over arching structures that define html elements. An element can be one of two types, and <code>inline</code> element or a <code>block</code> element. So what distinguishes the two?
        <p class='img_text'>This paragraph is a block element. A block element can accept specifications like 'padding' and 'margin' both vertically and horizontally. However, it's defining characteristic is the line break that preceeds and follows it by default. A block element will also take up the full width available. </p>
        <p class='img_text'>An inline element, such as a <code>span</code> is displayed 'inline' meaning it cannot accept vertical margin or padding (horizontal is acceptable) and is not followed by a line break. It will only take up as much width as needed. Additionally, it allows other elements to sit on it's left and right by default.</p>
        <p class='img_text'>So with the definition of 'inline' and 'block' settled, let's move on to <code>display:inline-block</code>. This will take an element and display it 'inline' meaning it will not be preceeded and followed by a line break. It also will only take up as much width as needed. However, it CAN accept vertical and horizontal margin/padding.</p>
        <p class='img_text'> The following text has the <code>display:inline-block</code> property set. <span class ='inlineblock'>Inline-Block Text.</span>Notice how it has both vertical and horizontal margin and padding? Also notice how this text is pushed down due to the padding and margin surrounding the text.</p>
        <p class='img_text'>The following text has the <code>display:inline</code> property set. If you inspect the element you see I have tried to set a vertical margin and it is not accepted. <span class='inline'>Inline Text.</span> An interesting thing to note about inline elements displayed this way, is that you can specify a padding both horizontally and vertically. The nearby elements will only move to accomodate the padding left and right but the vertical padding will show up and go into the space of the nearby elements. See the example in the next paragraph.</p>
        <p>The text following is displayed inline but has a vertical and horizontal padding. <span class='inlinepadding'>This is displayed inline.</span> Notice how the padding just sort of expands vertically? The padding will expand into the elements around it, but it won't force anything farther down the page.</p>
