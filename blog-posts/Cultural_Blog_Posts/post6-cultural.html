        <h1 class="title">Post Six: Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <p class="img_text">This post is about a phenomenom called 'stereotype threat'. It can be defined as:<blockquote>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.</blockquote></p>
        <p>The article then lays out this example. <blockquote>This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes.</blockquote></p>
        <p>To me, the big takeaway here that can be applied to DBC, is that WITHIN the learning environment, attributes such as race/gender should never be emphasized. I'm all for race/gender being taken into account BEFORE the cohort starts, as you want to encourage people of all backgrounds to learn to program, but based on the above, it appears an over emphasis on this can have a measurably derogatory effect within the learning environment itself.</p>
