        <h1 class="title">Post Five: Pairing is Caring and Feedback</h1>
        <p class="img_text">This post is all about programming in a paired environment.</p>
        <p>Thus far, I have found pairing fun and rewarding. It is much less isolating than working on your own, and it's tremendously useful to have someone to bounce ideas off of as you're working. Additionally, it's great to be able to have someone coding, while someone else is researching the next piece that has to be done. I found, almost without exception, that working through challeneges with a pair, allowed us to finish quicker than had I been working on my own.</p>
        <p>Coming hand in hand with pairing, is the concept of feedback. After every pairing session, we are required to give actionalable, specific, and kind (ASK) feedback to our pair. At first, I think everyone was a bit uncomfortable doing this. It felt kind of strange to be rating someone on how you and they worked together. Over time however, once you get enough data points on yourself from others, you really see the benefit. If a pattern starts to emerge of things you could do better, it allows you to alter the way you pair with others to optimize the process for you and your pair.</p>
        <p>Overall, I really like paired programming. I think it's a nice change of pace from working by yourself, and allows you to develop a skillset for working as a team. Feedback seems to me like a natural extension of this.</p>
