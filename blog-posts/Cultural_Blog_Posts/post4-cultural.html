        <h1 class="title">Post Four: Where is the Diversity in Tech?</h1>
        <p class="img_text">A pretty hot topic recently has been the lack of diversity in technology companies. The following infographics about employee demographics at Google paint a pretty (white/male) picture of the tech giant.</p>
        <div id='image_div'><img src='../../images/chart-overall-e.svg' class='post_image left'/>
        <img src='../../images/menvswomen.svg' class='post_image right'/></div>
        <p>I think everyone can see the danger here. If you've got a predominantly white/male workforce you are going to a) lose out on a number of valuable perspectives a diverse workforce can provide and b) potentially more importantly, you are probably going to create a homogenous culture which may enable certain attitudes (see: brogrammer).</p>
        <p>While many think the solution is simple, simply hire more women and people of color, this viewpoint is myopic and fails to see the real issue. See the following quote for an idea of what I'm talking about.</p>
        <blockquote>Women earn roughly 18 percent of all computer science degrees in the United States. Blacks and Hispanics make up under 10 percent of U.S. college grads and collect fewer than 5 percent of degrees in CS majors, respectively.</blockquote>
        <p>What can be done in the face of these statistics? My alma matter, the USC Viterbi School of Engineering was at the forefront of gender diversity when I was there. Women made up 30% of Viterbi students. When the forefront of diversity is 30% at the collegiate level, you've got a systemic problem that needs to be dealt with. I think the answer lies in encouraging everyone to pursue technical subjects, which will create a diverse pipeline of talent for technology companies.</p>
