        <h1 class="title">Post Three: Visual Learner</h1>
        <p class="img_text">For this post we have been tasked with contemplating our learning style and what that will mean for our development as programmers.</p>
        <p>Personally, I wasn't too sure of my learning style when I first started, but that quickly changed as we started moving! I can absolutely say 100%, without a doubt, I am a visual and hands on learner. I perform best when I can <b>see</b> an example of something being done. I struggle mightily with lengthy articles or books on programming. I don't know why but my brain freezes up and I feel like I'm reading Greek. However, give me a video to watch and follow along with, and I've got it in no time. After reflecting on this a bit, I think I've always been this way, but it seems more pronounced on this particularly journey. Growing up playing sports, I always preferred to watch and follow along with my own movements. Same thing in college; multivariate calculus made no sense when I read about it, but when the teacher would go through an extensive example I felt much more at ease.</p>
        <p>I'm also noticing a change in terms of what I think I can do. I'm not quite ready to say I can do anything just yet, but I'll be dammed it I don't give it a shot. I'm find that once I became comfortable <em>knowing that I don't know everything</em>, research just becomes an accepted part of the process. Now I look forward to research as a way to improve my skillset vs an intimidating process</p>
