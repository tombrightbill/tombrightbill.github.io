      	 <p class="img_text"><a class ="web_link" href="http://longform.org/">Longform.org</a>, this is one of my favorite websites for longer content. The articles are curated from reliable sources and are always well written. Personally, I think it's a superbly uncluttered design that allows you to simply scroll through the stories on the left and choose what interests you. I'd say the website is minimalist, organized, branded well, and somehow exudes a library like feel appropriate for a website delivering meaty content.  This website solves the user issue of finding meaningful content. You can filter everything based on specific categories like "business" or "entertainment". Or simply choose from the whole list of curated articles. It's minimalist design makes the page extremely navigable. I always feel more educated after visiting Longoform, as the articles typically take a more exhaustive approach to content vs something shorter and sensational.</p>
      	 <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, The quintessential start up news source, Y Combinator's Hacker news is a website I frequent a lot. I think it's dated appearance is meant to draw the focus away from the superficial and allow users to focus on content. Though one of the more intimidating and difficult to navigate news webistes, it's extremely intelligent community keeps the content very relavent. There is very little styling on the website, which very much resembles a Reddit like forum, but with less clutter.</p>
      	 <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="http://pitchfork.com"/>Pitchfork</a>, A respected music website, I find myself frequenting this spot to discover new tunes. Like anything relating to music, presention is paramount, and Pitchfork really excels here. The branding and imagery is on point, making the the website appear as trendy as the music it reviews. Additionally, the ability to stream almost anything form the website is great. Occasionally, it can suffer from feeling cluttered, as its panel layout continues for ages. However, this is probably just part and parcel with trying to deliver coverage on 100s of artists at once. A very slick website who's only drawback in my opinion, is delivering too much content.</p>
