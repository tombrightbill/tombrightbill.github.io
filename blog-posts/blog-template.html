      	 <p class="img_text">This is Tom Brightbill's blog for the Pocket Mice cohort at DevBootCamp beginning October 6th. He's nervous and excited to learn a new skillset and use it to advance him professionally. When DBC is complete he is interested in pursuing a job in either development, sales engineering, or product management.</p>
      	 <p class="img_text">When not drinking web development from the firehose he can be found zipping around town on his motorcycle, playing squash with his mates, and generally finding a way to have a good time. Other interests include reading, running, music, and keeping up with friends new and old. </p>
      	 <p class="img_text" "footer_head">For any feedback, which is readily welcomed, please hit the email button and write him an email with your thoughts. Cheers!</p>
