        <p class="about_text">Welcome! And thank you so much for stopping by. This will be the source of truth as I document my journey through DevBootcamp. It will certainly be both an exhilarating experience as well as a challenging one.</p>
        <p class='about_text'> A little background about myself. I studied Industrial Engineering as an undergraduate at the University of Southern California. I was also fortunate enough to spend a year abroad at the London School of Economics learning finance fundamentals and econometrics. After school, I joined up with Capgemini as part of the SAP Implementation group and got to travel the world as an SAP Consultant. Once life on the road became too much to handle, I worked as a Technical Account Manager at Confirmit, a survey and reporting platform.</p>
        <p class='about_text'>While at Confirmit I was exposed to every avenue of the business. I became a 'developer' on the Confirmit platform but felt I was at a crossroads. I either needed to become more technical and really understand how software is created, or became less technical and find success in another piece of the business. It was time to get off the technical fence and choose a side! If you're at this website, I imagine you have deduced which path I have decided to take.</p>
        <p class='about_text'>After this experience is complete, I am interested in talking to anyone and everyone about positions in development, product management, and sales engineering. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
