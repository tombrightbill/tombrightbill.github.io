Hi there. I'm Tom Brightbill, aspiring web developer.

After college, I became a functional SAP consultant and a technical account manager/sales engineer after that.  Throughout my time in the tech industry I've learned a number of things about myself, the direction I'm interested in taking, and the industry I work in.

1. I'm genuinely curious how software is created
2. Without knowing the underlying principles of how software is created, you are setting yourself up to have a huge blind spot if you work in the tech industry.

To remedy my current knowledge base (which contains some very basic web-design), I have elected to embark on a 9 week journey and join DevBootCamp in San Francisco. This blog will act as the source of truth as I document my journey.

I'm both nervous and excited. I imagine emerging from the experience exhausted, but with a brand new skill set and loads of ideas! Feel free to reach out to me via email or linkedin, or take a peek at my repo, all of which are linked on the home page. Cheers!
