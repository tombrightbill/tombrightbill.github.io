        <h1 class="title">Post Six: Stereotype Threat</h1>
        <p class="img_text">This post is about a phenomenom called 'stereotype threat'. It can be defined as:<blockquote>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.</blockquote></p>
        <p>The article then lays out this example. <blockquote>This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes.</blockquote></p>
        <p>To me, the big takeaway here that can be applied to DBC, is that WITHIN the learning environment, attributes such as race/gender should never be emphasized. I'm all for race/gender being taken into account BEFORE the cohort starts, as you want to encourage people of all backgrounds to learn to program, but based on the above, it appears an over emphasis on this can have a measurably derogatory effect within the learning environment itself.</p>

        <p class="img_text">This post is all about programming in a paired environment.</p>
        <p>Thus far, I have found pairing fun and rewarding. It is much less isolating than working on your own, and it's tremendously useful to have someone to bounce ideas off of as you're working. Additionally, it's great to be able to have someone coding, while someone else is researching the next piece that has to be done. I found, almost without exception, that working through challeneges with a pair, allowed us to finish quicker than had I been working on my own.</p>
        <p>Coming hand in hand with pairing, is the concept of feedback. After every pairing session, we are required to give actionalable, specific, and kind (ASK) feedback to our pair. At first, I think everyone was a bit uncomfortable doing this. It felt kind of strange to be rating someone on how you and they worked together. Over time however, once you get enough data points on yourself from others, you really see the benefit. If a pattern starts to emerge of things you could do better, it allows you to alter the way you pair with others to optimize the process for you and your pair.</p>
        <p>Overall, I really like paired programming. I think it's a nice change of pace from working by yourself, and allows you to develop a skillset for working as a team. Feedback seems to me like a natural extension of this.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post Four: Where is the Diversity in Tech?</h1>
        <p class="img_text">A pretty hot topic recently has been the lack of diversity in technology companies. The following infographics about employee demographics at Google paint a pretty (white/male) picture of the tech giant.</p>
        <div id='image_div'><img src='../images/chart-overall-e.svg' class='post_image left'/>
        <img src='../images/menvswomen.svg' class='post_image right'/></div>
        <p>I think everyone can see the danger here. If you've got a predominantly white/male workforce you are going to a) lose out on a number of valuable perspectives a diverse workforce can provide and b) potentially more importantly, you are probably going to create a homogenous culture which may enable certain attitudes (see: brogrammer).</p>
        <p>While many think the solution is simple, simply hire more women and people of color, this viewpoint is myopic and fails to see the real issue. See the following quote for an idea of what I'm talking about.</p>
        <blockquote>Women earn roughly 18 percent of all computer science degrees in the United States. Blacks and Hispanics make up under 10 percent of U.S. college grads and collect fewer than 5 percent of degrees in CS majors, respectively.</blockquote>
        <p>What can be done in the face of these statistics? My alma matter, the USC Viterbi School of Engineering was at the forefront of gender diversity when I was there. Women made up 30% of Viterbi students. When the forefront of diversity is 30% at the collegiate level, you've got a systemic problem that needs to be dealt with. I think the answer lies in encouraging everyone to pursue technical subjects, which will create a diverse pipeline of talent for technology companies.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post Three: Visual Learner</h1>
        <p class="img_text">For this post we have been tasked with contemplating our learning style and what that will mean for our development as programmers.</p>
        <p>Personally, I wasn't too sure of my learning style when I first started, but that quickly changed as we started moving! I can absolutely say 100%, without a doubt, I am a visual and hands on learner. I perform best when I can <b>see</b> an example of something being done. I struggle mightily with lengthy articles or books on programming. I don't know why but my brain freezes up and I feel like I'm reading Greek. However, give me a video to watch and follow along with, and I've got it in no time. After reflecting on this a bit, I think I've always been this way, but it seems more pronounced on this particularly journey. Growing up playing sports, I always preferred to watch and follow along with my own movements. Same thing in college; multivariate calculus made no sense when I read about it, but when the teacher would go through an extensive example I felt much more at ease.</p>
        <p>I'm also noticing a change in terms of what I think I can do. I'm not quite ready to say I can do anything just yet, but I'll be dammed it I don't give it a shot. I'm find that once I became comfortable <em>knowing that I don't know everything</em>, research just becomes an accepted part of the process. Now I look forward to research as a way to improve my skillset vs an intimidating process</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post Two: Fireside Redux</h1>
        <p class="img_text">I have to say I really enjoyed watching that video. Shareef really nailed a number of things I think we are all thinking. The movement on my mindset has run the gamut from, 'This is too hard!' to 'This is too easy! and normally ends at 'Am I crazy? Do I have any idea what I'm doing?' To me, learning how to undertake something completely new and challenging like this is almost as big of a mental challenge as a technical one.</p>
         <p class="img_text">I am looking forward to learning in such a dynamic environment! I really enjoyed the bits about how in order to create an atmosphere where everyone is comfortable saying 'I don't know', the competitive nature in the cohort can only be friendly at it's most extreme. I feel the same way. I'm prepared to scream 'I don't know' from the get go, and I hope everyone else is as well. I'm just glad, to Shareef's point, there is enough demand for people with this skillset that we can actually focus on learning the material and teaching each other, rather than looking to one up all the time.</p>
         <p class="img_text">I would certainly be lying if I didn't say I was nervous. This first week has already been pretty demanding and we have 8 more of those! Then we're in a classroom for 12 hours a day? It's going to be what I hope is a trasformative journey, so I'm probably equal parts nervous and excited.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Post One: Favorite Websites</h1>
        <p class="img_text"><a class ="web_link" href="http://longform.org/">Longform.org</a>, this is one of my favorite websites for longer content. The articles are curated from reliable sources and are always well written. Personally, I think it's a superbly uncluttered design that allows you to simply scroll through the stories on the left and choose what interests you. I'd say the website is minimalist, organized, branded well, and somehow exudes a library like feel appropriate for a website delivering meaty content.  This website solves the user issue of finding meaningful content. You can filter everything based on specific categories like "business" or "entertainment". Or simply choose from the whole list of curated articles. It's minimalist design makes the page extremely navigable. I always feel more educated after visiting Longoform, as the articles typically take a more exhaustive approach to content vs something shorter and sensational.</p>
         <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, The quintessential start up news source, Y Combinator's Hacker news is a website I frequent a lot. I think it's dated appearance is meant to draw the focus away from the superficial and allow users to focus on content. Though one of the more intimidating and difficult to navigate news webistes, it's extremely intelligent community keeps the content very relavent. There is very little styling on the website, which very much resembles a Reddit like forum, but with less clutter.</p>
         <p class="img_text"><a class="web_link" href="http://pitchfork.com"/>Pitchfork</a>, A respected music website, I find myself frequenting this spot to discover new tunes. Like anything relating to music, presention is paramount, and Pitchfork really excels here. The branding and imagery is on point, making the the website appear as trendy as the music it reviews. Additionally, the ability to stream almost anything form the website is great. Occasionally, it can suffer from feeling cluttered, as its panel layout continues for ages. However, this is probably just part and parcel with trying to deliver coverage on 100s of artists at once. A very slick website who's only drawback in my opinion, is delivering too much content.</p>
