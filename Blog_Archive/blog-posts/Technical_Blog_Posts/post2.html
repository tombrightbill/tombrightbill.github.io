        <h1 class="title">Post Two: Why Javascript?</h1>
        <p>In this post I will discuss my understanding of the applications of Javascript thus far.</p>
        <p>Javascript is a client side scripting language and is rendered by the browser on your local machine. This means the code is passed to the browser and the it's up to the browser to run it. One advantage of this is you can actually see any JS running in your browser. You can observe it take place in the console via your devtools.</p>
        <p>Working in tandem with HTML and CSS, JS can help bring a webpage to life with animations and allows you to directly interact with elements in the DOM. For example if you wanted the background image of a div to change when the user clicks on that div, JS would be your go to! You'd simply use an event handler, like an 'onclick' and use JS to dynamically replace the image. Pretty cool no?</p>
        <p>In essence, Javascript allows the webpage to respond to user actions without the need to reload the page. For example, you don't have to fill out a lengthy form, submit it, then have the system tell you mistakes were made anymore. JS can help you validate the entries as you are making them, right on your web browser. This gets rid of a step (validating on the server side) and makes the user experience much better.</p>
        <p>Also, JS can be used asynchronously (in the background). This means that functions can run outside of the document flow, and request information from the server without any interaction or need to re-load a web page. This discipline is called AJAX (asynchronous Javascript and XML). This is a bit beyond our current level at the moment but I'm excited to get there and learn about it!
