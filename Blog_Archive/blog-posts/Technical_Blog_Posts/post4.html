        <h1 class="title">Post Four: You Classy Huh?</h1>
        <p>This post will cover classes, which can be most easily explained using a real world example. Let's say you drive a Honda Accord, and you've named your car Max. Your car has a number of attributes, shared amongst all Honda Accords. It get 25mpg, has a full tank capacity of 10 gallons, and can seat 5. You car Max, is a specific instance of a Honda Accord.</p>
        <p>In Ruby, or any Object Oriented Language, the 'Honda Accord' would be the 'class' and you car 'Max' would be an instance of the class 'Honda Accord'. 'Max' would have a number of characteristics shared amongst all in the 'Honda Accord' class, but may also have some attributes that apply only to that instance, such as 'owner' and 'color'. Let's go ahead and create the 'Honda Accord' class to see what I mean.</p>
        <div id="blockcode">
        <code>Class Honda_Accord</code>
                <code>attr_reader :owner, :color, :mpg, :tank</code>

                <code>def initialize(owner, color)</code>
                  <code>@owner = owner</code>
                  <code>@color = color</code>
                  <code>@mpg = 25</code>
                  <code>@tank = 11</code>
                <code>end</code>

                <code>def drive_highway(hours)</code>
                  <code>@tank-= (hours*50)/25</code>
                <code>end</code>

                <code>def change_owner(new_owner)</code>
                  <code>@owner = new_owner</code>
                <code>end</code>
              <code>end</code>
            <code>Max = Honda_Accord.new('Tom', 'British Racing Green')</code>
      </div>
      <p>So what we have done here is create a class called 'Honda_Accord' and assign certain attributes to the class. It has an owner attribute, which is assigned when an instance is created (i.e. 'Max'). Sae with the color attribute. We've got an mpg attribute, and a tank attribute (number of gallons it can hold). The funny '@' simply means that each instance of this class will have this variable when it is initialized. Additionally, we've defined some methods to go with our class so if I called <code>Max.drive_highway(3)</code> it would subtract (50 miles/hour * 3 hours)/25 miles per gallons = 6 gallons from the full tank so we would have 5 gallons left. The funky <code>attr_reader</code> simply means that certain instance variables can be called on and viewed. For example I can call <code> Max.owner</code> and <code>Max.tank</code> which will return 'Tom' and '5' respectively (assuming we go through with our <code>Max.drive_highway(3)</code> call).</p>
